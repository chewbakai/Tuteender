# Tuteender
Tuteender is designed for a people who seek help and who wish to lend help. The idea was originally from our Web Development 1 Project and is recycled for the Application Development requirement as well. This time, I will be using  Express framework in NodeJS and uses sequelize as an ORM to interface with PHP.
