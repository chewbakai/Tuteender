                    <h4>Welcome to Tuteender</h4>
                    <p>
                      Tuteender was a project made by Kyrah Ceniza and Kirk Poro
                      back in 2019. They were both second year college students in
                      Information Technology and Computer Science, respectively
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tuteender was created and was thought of by the creators as
                      the courses they had undergone, were by no means, easily
                      self-taught through the countless tutorials and lessons that
                      were found on the internet, as programming, in essence does
                      not have a structured nor a definite way.

                              it’s easy to use, and well-crafted. The entire experience should feel purposeful, 
                              and put the needs of the learner first.
